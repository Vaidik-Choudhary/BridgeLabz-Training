# 🗓 Week 4 : Collections Framework in Java

## 📘 Section A : Training Learning Progress

### 🗓 Day 22 – Java Generics Fundamentals
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**
- Set up and revised the `java-collections-practice` branch structure.
- Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling.
- Understood Type Parameters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`) and their role in APIs.
- Implemented Generic Classes and Generic Methods.
- Used Bounded Types (`extends`, `super`) to restrict and control types.
- Applied Wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`) for flexible collections.
- Followed Generics best practices (no raw types, safe bounds, readable design)

### 🗓 Day 24 – Java I/O Streams  
**(Date: 21-Jan-2026)**
- Studied Java I/O Streams architecture and stream-based data handling.
- Covered Byte Streams and Character Streams for file operations.
- Learned and implemented:
  - `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`
  - `FileReader`, `FileWriter`
  - `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`
  - `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`
- Understood Object Streams:
  - `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`
  - Serialization and deserialization
- Practiced in-memory streams:
  - `ByteArrayInputStream`, `ByteArrayOutputStream`
- Used bridge streams:
  - `InputStreamReader`, `OutputStreamWriter`
- Applied try-with-resources, buffering, and performance best practices.
- Solved practical problems including file copy, serialization, and efficient large-file reading.
- Committed and pushed all work.

### 🗓 Day 25 – Exception Handling
**(Date: 23-Jan-2026)**
- Studied Java exception handling and exception hierarchy.
- Differentiated between checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Implemented `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and multiple catch blocks.
- Practiced handling common runtime exceptions.
- Used nested `try-catch` for granular error handling.
- Applied `throw` and `throws` for exception creation and propagation.
- Designed and implemented custom exceptions for business rules.
- Used try-with-resources for automatic resource management.
- Solved scenario-based exception handling problems.
- Committed and pushed all work.
