# 🗓 Week 6 : Java 8 Features 

## 📘 Section A : Training Learning Progress

### 🗓 Day 01 – Lambda Expressions, Method References & Interfaces 
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**
- Set up and revised the `java8-programming-practice` branch structure.
- Studied Java 8 goals and functional-programming concepts.
- Learned lambda expression syntax and target typing.
- Implemented custom and predefined functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`).
- Practiced method references:
  - Static, instance, and constructor forms.
- Applied Java-8 best practices.
- Solved practice problems and committed all work.

### 🗓 Day 02 – Streams & Collectors  
**(Date: 28-Jan-2026)**
- Studied Java Stream API fundamentals and lazy evaluation.
- Practiced stream creation from collections, arrays, and generators.
- Used intermediate operations:
  - `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `sorted`, `distinct`, `limit`.
- Applied terminal operations:
  - `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`, `count`, `findFirst`.
- Learned Collectors usage:
  - `toList`, `toSet`, `joining`
  - `groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`, `summarizingInt`.
- Practiced parallel streams and performance considerations.
- Implemented a mini project and Java 8 workshop using Streams and Collectors:
  - Appointment filtering, grouping, counting, and sorting.
- Solved practice problems and committed all work.
