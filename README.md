# 🗓 Week 4 : Collections Framework in Java

## 📘 Section A : Training Learning Progress

### 🗓 Day 01 – Java Generics Fundamentals
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**
- Set up and revised the `java-collections-practice` branch structure.
- Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling.
- Understood Type Parameters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`) and their role in APIs.
- Implemented Generic Classes and Generic Methods.
- Used Bounded Types (`extends`, `super`) to restrict and control types.
- Applied Wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`) for flexible collections.
- Followed Generics best practices (no raw types, safe bounds, readable design)

### 🗓 Day 04 – Exception Handling
**(Date: 23-Jan-2026)**
- Studied Java exception handling and exception hierarchy.
- Differentiated between checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Implemented `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and multiple catch blocks.
- Practiced handling common runtime exceptions.
- Used nested `try-catch` for granular error handling.
- Applied `throw` and `throws` for exception creation and propagation.
- Designed and implemented custom exceptions for business rules.
- Used try-with-resources for automatic resource management.
- Solved scenario-based exception handling problems.
- Committed and pushed all work.

- Worked with `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes.
- Practiced regex metacharacters and quantifiers.
- Implemented validations for:
  - Email addresses
  - Password strength
  - Phone numbers
- Used regex operations:
  - `find()`, `matches()`, `replaceAll()`
- Extracted structured data:
  - Dates, hashtags, domain names
- Learned JUnit fundamentals and testing lifecycle.
- Used JUnit 5 annotations:
  - `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`
- Implemented:
  - Parameterized tests and repeated tests
  - Exception testing using `assertThrows`
- Applied assertion APIs:
  - `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertAll`
- Followed Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) testing pattern.
